Introduction
===

In this project, I'll be taking my first steps with [DBT](https://www.getdbt.com). I'll be following the use case from [Solve any data analysis problem, Chapter 2](https://github.com/davidasboth/solve-any-data-analysis-problem/blob/main/chapter-2/Chapter%202%20example%20solution.ipynb) as I did before, but this time I'll be using DBT.

DBT allows me to implement data transforms as a collection of SQL scripts which can be easily run in a simple and consistent manner. 

See:

- [DBT basics with postgres](spike_postgres/ReadMe.md) - create some model, run against postgres, end up with views in postgres with transformed data
